                <h3>Eye Strain (Computer Vision Syndrome)</h3>
                <p>Long screen time can lead to blurred vision, headaches, and dry eyes.
                     The 20-20-20 rule—looking at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes—helps reduce strain.
                    computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) is a condition caused by prolonged use of digital screens, resulting in symptoms like dry eyes, blurred vision, headaches, and neck or shoulder pain.
                    The strain occurs because screens require intense focus, often causing us to blink less, leading to eye dryness and discomfort. To prevent CVS, follow a few simple steps: —reduce screen brightness 
                    and glare by adjusting room lighting and using anti-glare filters; and enable blue light filters on your devices, especially in the evening. 
                    Frequent blinking also helps keep your eyes moist. If symptoms continue, it's best to consult an eye specialist for tailored advice.

                <h3>Musculoskeletal Problems</h3>
                <p>Musculoskeletal problems related to digital device use are common, especially with prolonged sitting or poor posture, which can cause issues like back pain, neck strain, and carpal tunnel syndrome.
                    These issues arise when muscles, joints, and tendons are overused or placed in uncomfortable positions for extended periods.

                <h3>Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI)</h3>
                <p>Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI) are a group of musculoskeletal disorders caused by repetitive motions, overuse, or prolonged strain on certain body parts, often affecting the wrists, hands, shoulders, and elbows.
                    Common activities that lead to RSI include typing, mouse use, and prolonged gaming or phone use, which can cause inflammation, pain, numbness, and reduced flexibility in the affected areas.</p>

                     leading to feelings of inadequacy, while constant notifications create “notification anxiety,” disrupting focus and relaxation. Blue light from screens before bed disrupts sleep,
                      which can increase irritability and stress. Information overload,especially from negative news, can further heighten anxiety levels. Limiting screen time, turning off notifications .</p>

                <h3>Sleep Disorders</h3>
                <p>Digital device use, particularly before bed, exposes users to blue light that interferes with melatonin production, a hormone essential for sleep. 
                    Poor sleep quality not only leads to physical fatigue but also contributes to anxiety and irritability, creating a cycle of stress.</p>
